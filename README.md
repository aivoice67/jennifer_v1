# Deployment Notes

## Vercel Deployment

On Vercel the Express server is not used; instead the API is implemented as serverless functions:
- `api/chat.ts`
- `api/insights.ts`
- `api/health.ts`

Build output is generated by `npm run build` (Vercel runs automatically). Static assets are served from `dist/` and functions handle `/api/*`.

If you previously relied on `VITE_BACKEND_URI`, remove it (same-origin relative calls are used). Ensure the following env vars are configured in the Vercel dashboard:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- HUME_API_KEY
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (and optionally ELEVENLABS2_API_KEY)
- AUTH_PIN (or VITE_AUTH_PIN depending on usage in code)

`vercel.json` routes `/api/*` to functions and everything else to `/dist`.
